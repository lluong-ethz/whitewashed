## Introduction

This is the repository of our project for Tweet Sentiment Analysis in the ETHZ's CIL class, 2024 edition.
In this repo you will find the source code, the project report, as well as indications on how to run experiments.

All the source code can be found under the folder `src`. \
The data used can be found under `src\data`. \
The embedding methods can be found under `src\embeddings`. \
The models used can be found under `src\models`.

## Setup

We suppose you have `conda` installed on your machine.
You can create an environment with all the necessary dependencies with:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
You can then activate the environment with:
```
conda activate cil_twitter
```


## Data
We first suppose you already have the Twitter dataset as it was given to us. Moreover, you can obtain the Glove embeddings at [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). You should download only the Wikipedia and Twitter pre-trained word vectors. The data organization should look like this

```console

        ├── train_neg.txt
        ├── train_pos_full.txt
        ├── train_pos.txt
```


## Experiments

For the baseline models, you can run the experiments from [Baselines notebook](src/baselines_notebook.ipynb) (and run the relevant cells depending on which models / embeddings you want to use). \
For the BERT model, you can run the experiments from [Bert notebook](src/run_bert.ipynb). \
Note: you need to run all your experiments from `src`.
